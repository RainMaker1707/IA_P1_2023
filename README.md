# IA_P1_2023

- The main file for this project is `tower_sorting.py`
- It is not allowed to modify search.py or utils.py as INGInious use it's own version to test `tower_sorting.py`
- We had to modified the `State` and `TowerSorting(Problem)` classes

- To simplify the tests on all instances I provide a little bash script `launch.sh` which allow to launch the tower_sorting on all instances in the `./instances/` directory
- `<files>.txt` are result of tests and their name express the search algorithm used in `tower_sorting.py`.
- You can launch it  (after done `chmod +x launch.sh`) from `./launch.sh <OUTPUT-FILE-PATH>`
